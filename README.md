# delivery_agent_project_24MIM10178
This project builds an autonomous delivery agent in a 2D grid city. It navigates static and dynamic obstacles using BFS, Uniform Cost, A*, and local search strategies. The agent is tested on different maps, comparing efficiency, path cost, and replanningÂ ability.
